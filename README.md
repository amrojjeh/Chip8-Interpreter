# Chip8-Interpreter

A Chip8 Interpreter made with SDL

## HOW TO COMPILE????
- With the current build file, this can be only compiled on Windows machines
- You need the Visual Studio C++ Compiler
- Add vcvarsall in your path
- Run Build.bat
- Executable should be in the build folder


## HOW TO RUN?!?!?!
You need to use command prompt in order to load whichever ROM you wanna load.
So the command would look like this: 

`build\main.exe ROMs\15puzzle.c8`


## Planned changes
- Change batch to CMake (This allows the build file to be cross platform and cross compiler)
