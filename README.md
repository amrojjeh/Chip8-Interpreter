# Chip8-Interpreter

A Chip8 Interpreter made with SDL2

## How to compile
How you compile this is mostly up to you, since I've included no build file.
But here are the things that you NEED inorder to compile this:

- SDL2 (Make sure that you download SDL2 and link it also)
- I personally used G++ to compile this, so if you want the exact same result
 than you can use G++ version 6.3.0-1

## How to run
As of now, running it without the command line is practically impossible.
You need to launch through the command line and then add the ROM
that you want to be launched as an argument. For example: `main.exe someRom.c8`
 

## Planned changes (Ordered by priority)
- Start using CMake
- Actually finish Chip8...
- Make an assembler
